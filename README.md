# csc221-final
Final Exam programming challenge

Create a set of scripts that do the following with the file:
'nasa.tsv'

- Provides a list of unique hosts
- Provides a list of the most popular URLs

# Solutions

The 'nasa.tsv' file, along with the two solution scripts, are found in
~/mcclement/csc221/csc221-final. The solution to the first problem is found
in the file 'solution_1.sh' while the solution to the second problem is
found in the file 'solution_2.sh.'

# Solution 1

In order to determine the list of unique hosts within the 'nasa.tsv' file,
cd into ~/mcclement/csc221/csc221-final and then, from the command line,
call 'bash solution_1.sh.' A text file called 'unique_hosts.txt' resides
within the same parent directory, and it is to this file that the list of
unique hosts will be written.

# Solution 2

In order to determine the top ten most popular URLs within the 'nasa.tsv' file,
cd into ~/mcclement/csc221/csc221-final and then, from the command line,
call 'bash solution_2.sh.' A text file called 'most_popular.txt' resides
within the same parent directory, and it is to this file that the list of the
top ten most popular URLs will be written.
